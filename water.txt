I am grateful for water.
Water sometimes looks blue.
Water makes things wet.
Water can be diluted with concentrate to make squash.
The main benefit of squash is to alter the taste of water.
Water evaporates at 100 degrees Celsius and becomes water vapour.
The warm air rises with the water vapour and become clouds.
The warm air cools, and loses its ability to contain water vapour.
Resulting in condensation in the atmosphere.
Condensation is the transformation of water from a gaseous state to a liquid state.
When clouds condense it rains.
