I am grateful for water.
Water sometimes looks blue.
Water makes things wet.
Water can be diluted with concentrate to make squash.
The main benefit of squash is to alter the taste of water.
Water quenches thirst and it allows your cells, tissues, joints and organs to work properly. 
Water regulates your body temperature, especially during physical activity, and helps get rid of waste.
